##The Binomial Package

The binomial distribution is one of the most well known distributions in statistics. This package includes functions that are intended to make the calculations for the binomial distribution easier and the outputs clearer.

##Motivation

The point of this package is to explore the possibilities available when creating a package in R. It exposes the individual to all the behind-the-scenes aspects such as testing, auxiliary functions, and private functions.

##Examples of the binomial package in use

```{r}
library(binomial)

#chances of getting 6 successes in 10 trials
binomial

#binomial distribution
```
