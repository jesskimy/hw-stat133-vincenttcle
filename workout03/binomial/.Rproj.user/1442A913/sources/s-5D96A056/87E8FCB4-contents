## The "binomial" Package
The binomial distribution is very common in statistics classes, and arguably one of the most well known distributions. Fundamentally, the distribution revolves around `n` number of trials, `k` number of successes, and `p` probability of a success. A very common example of a binomial distribution is a coin toss. If one were to wonder what the probability of landing 6 tails in 10 flips of a fair coin, one would use the equation for the binomial probability:

$$

Pr(X = k) =   \binom{n}{k} \cdot p^k(1-p)^{n-k}


$$

Using this equation, it is very common to produce tables and plots that visually represent the model of successes (or failures) given a set number of trials and probability of success. The purpose of the `binomial` package is to make it easier to do so.
