Cooking Recipe
==============

### Salted Butter Chocolate Chunk Shortbread

> *To find the complete recipe, click [here](https://smittenkitchen.com/2017/12/salted-butter-chocolate-chunk-shortbread/)*

##### Ingredients

-   1 cup and 2 tablespoons of salted butter, cold, and cut into small pieces
-   1/2 cup of granulated sugar
-   1/4 cup of light brown sugar
-   1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
-   2 and 1/4 cups of all-purpose flour
-   6 ounces of semi/bittersweet dark chocolate, chopped
-   1 large egg
-   Demerara, turbinado, raw, or sanding sugar, for rolling
-   Flaky sea salt for sprinkling

##### Kitchen Tools

-   Electric mixer
-   Mixing bowl
-   Parchment paper
-   Plastic wrap
-   Freezer
-   Sharp serrated knife
-   Oven
-   Wire rack

##### Recipe

1.  Beat the butter, granulated and brown sugars, and vanilla with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, scraping down bowl as needed. Add flour, and mix just until combined. Add chocolate chunks, mix just until incorporated. Mixture will look crumbly.
2.  Divide between two sheets of parchment paper, waxed paper, or plastic wrap and use your hands to form the dough halves into log shapes about 2 to 2 1/4 inches in diameter. Chill until totally firm, about 2 hours.
3.  When you’re ready to bake the cookies, heat your oven to 350°F. Line one or two large baking sheets with parchment paper. Lightly beat the egg and open up your chilled cookies logs to brush it over the sides. Sprinkle the coarse sugar on the open paper or plastic wrap and roll the logs into it, coating them.
4.  Using a sharp serrated knife, cut logs into 1/2-inch thick rounds. You’re going to hit some chocolate chunks, so saw gently, squeezing the cookie to keep it from breaking if needed. Arrange cookie slices on prepared sheets one inch apart (they don’t spread much) and sprinkle each with a few flakes of salt. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the edges are just beginning to get golden brown. Let cool slightly before transferring to the cookies you don’t eat immediately to wire racks to cool. Do ahead: The dough can made ahead and stored, tightly wrapped in plastic, up to 1 week in the fridge, or 1 month in the freezer. Baked cookies keep in an airtight container for 5 days. ![](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4633/39374555221_e735fd125d_z.jpg "Cookiez")

###### Alternative ingredients

If you don't have salted butter, you can make a substitute by using unsalted butter and then adding 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt.

Euclidean Distance
==================

### Definition

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them.

In [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates), if **p** =(*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** =(*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in [Euclidean *n*-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space), then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the [Pythagorean formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem).

$$d(\\textbf{p, q}) = d(\\textbf{q, p}) = \\sqrt{(q\_1 - p\_1)^2 + (q\_2 - p\_2)^2 + ... + (q\_n -p\_n)^2}  \\\\ = \\sqrt{\\sum\_{i =1}^n (q\_i - p\_i)^2}$$

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a [Euclidean vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector). So **p** or **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The [Euclidean norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_norm), or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$$
||\\textbf{p}|| = \\sqrt{p\_1^2 + p\_2^2 + ... + p\_n^2} = \\sqrt{\\textbf{p} \\cdot \\textbf{p} }
$$
 where the last expression involves the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product).

Describing a vector as a directed line segment from the [origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_(mathematics)) of the Euclidean space (vector tail), to a point in that space (vector tip), its length is actually the distance from its tail to its tip. The Euclidean norm of a vector is seen to be just the Euclidean distance between its tail and its tip.

The relationship between points **p** and **q** may involve a direction (for example, from **p** to **q**), so when it does, this relationship can itself be represented by a vector, given by

** q - p** = (*q*<sub>1</sub> − *p*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub> − *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub> − *p*<sub>*n*</sub>)
 In a two or three dimensional space (*n* = 2, 3), this can be visually represented as an arrow from **p** to **q**. In any space it can be regarded as the position of **q** relative to **p**. It may also be called a [displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector)) vector if **p** and **q** represent two positions of some moving point.

The Euclidean distance between **p** and **q** is just the Euclidean length of this displacement vector:

$$
||\\textbf{q - p}|| = \\sqrt{(\\textbf{q} - \\textbf{p}) \\cdot (\\textbf{q} - \\textbf{p})}
$$
 which is equivalent to equation 1, and also to:
$$
||\\textbf{q - p}|| = \\sqrt{||\\textbf{p}||^2 + ||\\textbf{q}||^2 - 2 \\textbf{p} \\cdot \\textbf{q}}
$$
