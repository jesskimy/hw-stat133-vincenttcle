# WORKOUT 2



This project is intended to demonstrate our use of an interactive Shiny Web App. The application allows the user to manipulate various variables such as initial amount invested, return rate, growth rate, etc, and returns a graph that displays a visual representation of the amount gained from three investment methods: no contribution, fixed contribution, and growing contribution.

The homework also incorporates the publishing of the created Shiny application via shinyapp.io.
